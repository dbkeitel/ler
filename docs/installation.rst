Installation
============

.. note::

    It is recommended to install gwsnr before installing ``ler``. See the `gwsnr documentation <https://github.com/hemantaph/gwsnr/>`_ .

.. tabs::

     .. code-tab:: console pip

        pip install ler gwsnr


This will install the dependencies needed but the version of gwsnr will not necessarily be the correct version for your system.


ler for development
===================

To install ``ler`` for development purposes use <https://github.com/hemantaph/ler/>`_.
