``ler`` (/ˈɛlɚ/): Lensed (or un-lensed) gravitational waves Event (compact-binaries) Rate calculator and simulator.

``ler`` is a statistical based python package whose core function is to calculate detectable rates of gravitational waves events. Description available in the `Summary <https://ler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Summary.html>`_ section.

The code is available at `github.ler <https://github.com/hemantaph/ler>`_.
