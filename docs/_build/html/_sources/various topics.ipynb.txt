In general cosmological terms it is calculated as the volume element at a given redshift per unit solid angle per unit redshift. You can generate it's value using the `astropy` package. Note that differential co-moving volume element is only a function of redshift. If you compare this with Equation A1 of llows the model presented in [WIERDA et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06303.pdf), you will see that $\\frac{dV_c}{\\, dz}$ is defined as the differential co-moving volume, without explicitly mentioning the solid angle, which is assumed to be already taken into account.
