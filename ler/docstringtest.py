"""Example Python module with Numpydoc-formatted docstrings.

This module demonstrates documentation written according to LSST DM's
guidelines for `Documenting Python APIs with Docstrings`_. Docstrings have
well-specified sections. This paragraph is considered an `Extended
Summary`_. Permitted sections are listed in `Numpydoc Sections in Docstrings`_.
You can't add arbitrary sections since they won't be parsed.

Notes
-----
Usually we don't write extensive module docstrings. Focus the module docstring
on information that a Stack developer needs to know when working inside that
module. Module *users* typically won't see module docstrings (instead they will
read module documentation topics written in the package's ``doc/`` directory).

    This is an example of a function docstring. Function parameters are
    documented in the ``Parameters`` section. See *Notes* for the format
    specification. See `Documenting Methods and Functions`_ for more
    information about function docstrings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : `int`
        The first parameter. Note how the type is marked up with backticks.
        This marks ``int`` as an API object so that Sphinx will attempt to
        link to its reference documentation. You can do this for custom types
        as well. You'll see an example in the `Returns`_ documentation.
    param2 : `str`, optional
        Optional arguments (those with defaults) always include the word
        ``optional`` after the type info. See the `Parameters`_ section
        documentation for details.
    *args
        Variable length argument list.
    **kwargs
        Arbitrary keyword arguments. If you do accept ``**kwargs``, make sure
        you link to documentation that describes what keywords are accepted,
        or list the keyword arguments here:

        - ``key1``: description (`int`).
        - ``key2``: description (`str`).

    Returns
    -------
    success : `bool`
        `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

        The return type is not optional. The ``Returns`` section may span
        multiple lines and paragraphs. Following lines should be indented to
        match the first line of the description.

        The ``Returns`` section supports any reStructuredText formatting,
        including literal blocks::

            {
                'param1': param1,
                'param2': param2
            }

        See the `Returns`_ section documentation for details.

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        Raised if <insert situation>.
    ValueError
        Raised if <insert situation>. See the `Raises`_ section documentation
        for details.

    Notes
    -----
    If ``*args`` or ``**kwargs`` are accepted, they should be listed as
    ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``.

    The format for a parameter is::

        name : type
            Description.

            The description may span multiple lines. Following lines
            should be indented to match the first line of the description.

            Multiple paragraphs are supported in parameter descriptions.
