    "<span style=\"color:blue; opacity:0.3\">*ref: The forces on stars, galaxies, and dark matter under external gravitational fields lead to the dynamical evolution of structures in the universe. The orbits of these bodies are therefore key to understanding the formation, history, and future state of galaxies. The field of \"galactic dynamics,\" which aims to model the gravitating components of galaxies to study their structure and evolution, is now well-established, commonly taught, and frequently used in astronomy. Aside from toy problems and demonstrations, the majority of problems require efficient numerical tools, many of which require the same base code (e.g., for performing numerical orbit integration).*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Gravitational waves (GWs) are ripples in the fabric of space and time caused by acceleration of unsymmetrically distributed mass/masses. Observable GWs are created especially during the violent events of merging compact binaries, such as 'binary black-holes' (BBH), 'binary neutron stars' (BNS). The gravitational waves emitted by these events are often distorted or magnified by the gravitational fields of massive objects such as galaxies or galaxy clusters, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Understanding the effects of gravitational lensing on GW signals is crucial for accurately interpreting these signals and extracting astrophysical information from them. In this field of physics, statistical modeling of GWs lensing can provide valuable insights into the properties of the lensing objects and the sources of gravitational waves. Such statistics requires accurate and efficient means to calculate the detectable lensing rates which in turn depends on upto-date modeling and implementation of lens and source properties and its distribution. These computational results will not only help in producing reliable predictions but helps in event validation of future lensing events [cite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03827).\n"
