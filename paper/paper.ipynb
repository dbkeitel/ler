    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Gravitational waves (GWs) are ripples in the fabric of space and time caused by the acceleration of unevenly distributed mass or masses. Observable GWs are created especially during the violent cosmic events of merging compact binaries, such as 'binary black holes' (BBH), 'binary neutron stars' (BNS) and 'neutron star and black hole pair' (NSBH). GWs emitted by these events can be distorted or magnified by the gravitational fields of massive objects such as galaxies or galaxy clusters, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Profound comprehension of gravitational lensing's impact on GW signals is imperative to their accurate interpretation and the extraction of astrophysical insights therein. for this purpose, statistical modelling of GWs lensing can provide valuable insights into the properties of the lensing objects and GW sources. Such statistics require accurate and efficient means to calculate the detectable lensing rates, which depend on up-to-date modelling and implementation of lens and source properties and its distribution. The outcomes of these computational analyses not only contribute to generating dependable forecasts but also play an important role in validating forthcoming lensing events [Ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03827).\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining precise outcomes in statistical analyses of this nature necessitates the utilization of large-scale sampling, often numbering in the millions. However, this process is computationally demanding. The <span style=\"font-family:cambria; color:maroon; font-weight: bold;\">LeR</span> framework employs innovative techniques to vectorize and parallelize the workflow efficiently. Additionally, it simplifies calculations through the utilization of interpolation and linear algebra. A further challenge entailed the seamless integration of disparate statistical components in a modular manner that facilitates adaptability, upgradability, and extendability. The LeR framework effectively addresses these complexities, offering user-friendly features that ensure seamless compatibility with other associated software packages. "

    "# Statement of need\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-family:cambria; color:maroon; font-weight: bold;\">LeR</span> is a statistical-based python package whose core function is designed for the computation of detectable rates pertaining to both lensed and unlensed gravitational wave (GW) events. This calculation intricately hinges upon the interplay of various components within the package, which can be categorized into four primary segments: `1.` Sampling the properties of compact-binary sources, `2.` Sampling the characteristics of lens galaxies, `3.` Solving the lens equations to derive the properties of the resultant images, and finally, `4.` Computing the rates of detectable GW events. The holistic functionality of the package is built upon leveraging array operations and linear algebra from the `numpy` library, complemented by interpolation methods from `scipy` and Python’s native `multiprocessing` capabilities. The software's efficiency is notably enhanced by the `numba` library's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which dynamically converts Python and NumPy code into machine code, thereby optimizing performance in numerical computations involving extensive loops and array operations. Predominantly, <span style=\"font-family:cambria; color:maroon; font-weight: bold;\">LeR</span> employs the inverse transform sampling method, utilizing interpolated inverse cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). This approach eschews the need for rejection sampling, which often requires numerous loops and the handling of complex probability density functions (PDFs) of the sampled parameters. The overall design of the package optimizes both speed and functionality while upholding user-friendliness. The architecture of the <span style=\"font-family:cambria; color:maroon; font-weight: bold;\">LeR</span> API is deliberately organized such that each distinct functionality holds its own significance in scientific research. Simultaneously, these functionalities seamlessly integrate and can be employed collectively based on specific research requirements. Key features of <span style=\"font-family:cambria; color:maroon; font-weight: bold;\">LeR</span> and its dependencies can be summarized as follows:"

    "    * For the unlensed events, The sampling distribution $(\\,R_m^U(z_s)\\,)$ for the source's redshift $(\\,z_s\\,)$ is derived from the merger rate density of compact binaries, which, in turn, is based on the star formation rate. The code is meticulously designed to enable the straightforward integration of future updates or user-specified distributions of these sources.\n",
    "    * The process of sampling both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of GW sources, represented by $\\theta_i$, utilizes the prior distributions $(P(\\theta_i))$ available within the `gwcosmo` and `bilby` Python packages. Before parameterizing the rate calculation, the software allows users the flexibility to manually alter any pertinent parameters as required. The said feature is employed when one doesn't specifically have a prior distribution for a particular parameter."

    "    * For the lensed case, sampling of $z_s$ is done with strong lensing condition $(\\text{SL})$ applied based on precomputed optical depth $(\\,P(z_s|\\tau)\\,)$. It is the probability of strong lensing of a source placed at red-shift $z_s$. Regeneration of $(\\,P(z_s|\\tau)\\,)$ is allowed with the specified lens galaxy configuration and its red-shift $z_l$ distribution. Multiprocessing and JIT functionality are employed to speed up this process.\n",
